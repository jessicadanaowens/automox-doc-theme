{{< faqcolumn >}}
{{< faqsection title="What is Automox?" icon="icon-custom-software">}}
Automox is the first cloud-based patching platform that fully automates the patch remediation process across Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and every third party software - including Adobe, Java, Firefox, Chrome, and Windows. The platform works across both clients and servers. From “click, set, forget” automation, to complete scheduling and workflow control, Automox enables customers greater security, improved productivity, and radical time savings.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="What can I tell my employees about the Automox agent if  they are concerned?" icon="icon-requirements">}}
You can let your staff know that the Automox agent is a simple lightweight tool that will ensure that their systems are up to date with all critical patches and that it does not, and will not, snoop, or have access to any sensitive or encrypted data. It is also important to pass along that by using Automox they help to make sure your company is more secure and not the next company in the headlines explaining why they had a data breach.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="How secure is Automox?" icon="icon-safe">}}
We take the security of our platform very seriously. Our development team has over a decade of experience building security applications for the cloud. Please visit our <a href="http://www.automox.com/security">security page</a> to learn more about security at Automox.

{{< faqsection title="How is Automox better than simply running Auto Updates?" icon="icon-Policies">}}
Running auto updates is like taking your security policy and dividing it up among each of your employees…and hoping that they patch and maintain their individual systems. This is fine for individuals or very small companies (10 employees or less) but for larger companies Auto Updates is more of a liability than a solution.

What you DON’T GET with Auto Updates:

* Almost every SW has an update feature, making the process of updating software a constant nuisance for the IT manager and the end user.
* There is no system (outside of Automox) that combines all of the OS and SW updates into a single easy to manage dashboard.
* Auto Updates does not give IT a central / single location for reporting on inventory, patch level, configuration settings, or compliance status.
* Auto Updates provides no reporting or verification of endpoint status, patches applied, or level of vulnerability.
* Auto Updates is inconsistent and unable to force the user to update / install critical security releases.
* Common malware silently disables OS Auto Updates and patching.
* 100% of Automox customers using other patching methods found and fixed existing critical patches with Automox.

## Patching
***
{{< faqcolumns >}}
{{< faqcolumn >}}
{{< faqsection title="What patches does Automox Apply?" icon="icon-patches">}}
Automox applies operating system patches for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Automox also natively patches third party software including Adobe Flash, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Java, Firefox, Chrome, MS Office, and others as part of our growing catalog. Automox also provides the ability to patch any software through custom scripting.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Can Automox deploy and patch custom or 3rd party  software?" icon="icon-rd-party-software">}}
Yes. Through the use of our Custom Policy Engine it is easy to set policies that deploy and patch both 3rd party and custom software.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Can I customize my remediation actions?" icon="icon-remediation">}}
Yes, you can customize almost any remediation action within the platform through the use of our custom policy engine.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Does Automox Patch Servers?" icon="icon-servers">}}
Yes, Automox patches Windows and Linux servers including cloud instances, dockers, and virtual machines.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="I don’t want full automation. Can I customize Automox to  match my manual patching workflow?" icon="icon-workflow">}}
Absolutely. The default setting of Automox is full automation, but you can easily turn the automation settings off in order to allow the system to match manual patch approval and deployment workflows.
{{< /faqsection >}}
{{< /faqcolumn >}}

{{< faqcolumn >}}
{{< faqsection title="What else can Automox do besides OS and 3rd Party  software patching?" icon="icon-control">}}
Unpatched Vulnerability Status: See the full status of your infrastructure at a single glance and know exactly what systems need attention.

View Your Complete Inventory: See the status of your full software & hardware inventory regardless of geographic location. Access historical logs for compliance reporting (PCI etc…) .

Manage both Clients and Servers: With Automox you can manage your full client and server infrastructure from a single pane of glass.

One-Click Reporting: With Automox pre-patch, post-patch, and executive reports, you’ll will spend more time waiting for them to come off the printer that you will putting them together. One-click reports makes auditing for compliance weekly status meetings a breeze.

Deploy and Patch 3rd Party Software: The Automox platform is also capable of deploying, patching, and enforcing required software on endpoints and servers. You can also blacklist unwanted software as well through our custom policy engine.

Manage Configurations / Customization: The Automox platform offers a custom policy engine that allows customers to create custom scripts for both evaluation and remediation that gives you control over everything on your system – from password length and printer drivers to firewall settings and USB access, and everything in between.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="What if I have a WSUS server? Do you work with that?  Do I need it?" icon="icon-Windows">}}
Automox interfaces with the Windows update application on the endpoint and can work with or without the WSUS server. If you like, you can install Automox, use it initially with your existing WSUS setup, and then point the endpoint back to Microsoft's repositories when you decide to remove WSUS from your network.

{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="How do I uninstall the agent?" icon="icon-uninstall">}}
See the <a href="https://www.automox.com/docs/user-guide/automox-agent/#agent-removal">Agent Removal Instructions</a> for details on uninstalling the Automox agent
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Does Automox require an agent?" icon="icon-agent">}}
Yes, Automox leverages a very lightweight agent (<10mb) that must be installed on every managed endpoint. For more detail on agent deployment see <a href="https://www.automox.com/docs/user-guide/agent-distribution/">"How to deploy the Automox agent.”</a>
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="What access does the Automox agent have on  an endpoint?" icon="icon-access-key">}}
The Automox agent has very limited access to the endpoint and is not natively capable of accessing or removing data or files from the device. Compared with other tools like Airwatch and others which have control of the camera, access to the mic, and can intercept data in transit that is not the intended functionality of Automox. Automox is not as invasive as other tools and can only add/update/delete software and configuration settings.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="How do I distribute the agent?" icon="icon-distrubite">}}
Automox provides scripts and documentation for doing remote, bulk deployment of the Automox agent, details of which can be found in our <a href="https://www.automox.com/docs/user-guide/agent-distribution/">Agent deployment documentation</a>. Operating-system specific deployment scripts are available for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and can be used with a number of deployment applications including Windows Group Policy. We also have scripts and supporting documentation to deploy Automox with Ansible and JumpCloud with more options on the way including Puppet and Chef.

{{< faqsection title="What is considered a system?" icon="icon-system">}}
Systems are defined as devices or instances inside or outside of corporate firewalls that are connected to the LAN or WAN and accept communications back and forth across the network. These include laptops, workstations, servers, docker containers, virtual machines, and cloud instances.

Automox does not yet support mobile device management (MDM) for tablets and phones.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="What's the difference between monthly and annual plans?" icon="icon-monthly">}}
Monthly plans are billed in advance each month, with overages billed at the end of each month. Annual plans are billed annually and eligible for a discounted rate off of the monthly plan rate. Overages on annual plans are also billed monthly at the end of each month at the contracted overage rate.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="What happens if I cancel my subscription?" icon="icon-cancellation">}}
If you decide to cancel your subscription, you will still have visibility to all of your systems, allowing you to monitor your infrastructure. We provide free lifetime monitoring where you can see new vulnerabilities, patch updates, and current configurations for each system. You won’t be able to patch or actively manage your systems until you reactivate your account, which you can do at any time in the Automox platform.
{{< /faqsection >}}

## How Does Automox Work
***
{{< faqcolumns >}}
{{< faqcolumn >}}
{{< faqsection title="What is the Automox setup process?" icon="icon-setup">}}
Setting up Automox within your organization is simple. Once you have created your account, simply log in to the platform and follow the getting started wizard to download the OS specific agent and install it on the endpoint. Once the agent is installed you will quickly see the endpoint in your dashboard with all of its attributes and software.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Are there any endpoint or server minimum requirements?" icon="icon-requirements">}}
No, as a Saas platform we are all about making our enterprise-grade patching solution available to companies of every size. To see if Automox features meet your patching needs, you can sign up for our Free 15 Day Trial to experience Automox for yourself.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Does the product work for MSPs?" icon="icon-msp">}}
The platform is designed to work for MSP customers along with large enterprises that want to manage multiple locations or departments as independent entities. Toggling between accounts is simple with our MSP feature seen below, and role based administrators can be assigned for each account.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="How do I customize the Automox platform?" icon="icon-customize">}}
Workflow Customization: Full automation is not for everyone. For customers that have a manual approval and test process Automox can easily match your custom workflows.

Creating Custom Policies: Native to the Automox platform is our Custom Policy Engine. Here, if you can script it, you can manage it. You will find a wide variety of pre-packaged custom scripts that customers have created, and you can create (and upload) your own. Every custom policy has an evaluation and remediation detail that can be customized.
{{< /faqsection >}}
{{< /faqcolumn >}}

{{< faqcolumn >}}
{{< faqsection title="What does Automox do behind the scenes?" icon="icon-curtain">}}
You can think of Automox as a powerful policy based engine that is constantly evaluating the state of a client or server and checking that state against a predefined policy. If the endpoint or server is found to be out of compliance with a policy, Automox will execute a remediation action that will bring the client or server back into compliance. Learn more on our <a href="http://www.automox.com/how-it-works">How It Works</a> page.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Can you manage multiple locations or accounts through the  Automox platform?" icon="icon-locations">}}
IT staff in large companies often operate as an internal managed service provider (MSP) supporting different departments and locations. Automox has native multi-site capabilities built into the platform that allow you to manage multiple locations / departments independently.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Does Automox have an API?" icon="icon-api">}}
Yes, Automox has a complete REST based API built into the core of our product. The Automox API is a powerful interface that allows you to integrate Automox reporting data into your applications and control the various settings of your account.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="Does Automox offer on-prem solutions?" icon="icon-on-perm">}}
Today Automox only offers a cloud-based platform for patching and securing your full client and server infrastructure. If you have concerns about the security of leveraging a cloud-based patching platform head over to <a href="http://www.automox.com/security">automox security</a>.

## Using Automox
***
{{< faqcolumns >}}
{{< faqcolumn >}}
{{< faqsection title="What operating systems does Automox support?" icon="icon-OSs">}}
We currently support the following operating system versions:

{{< unlinkedlist >}}
Windows 7+

Windows Server 2008 R2+

Mac OS X 10.8+

RedHat 6+

SUSE 11+

CentOS 6+

Fedora 20+

Debian 7+

Ubuntu 12+
{{< /unlinkedlist >}}
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="How do I work with groups?" icon="icon-groups">}}
Groups are a handy way to organize endpoints within your organization. Our grouping system is very similar to your computer’s filesystem structure, where each endpoint is a file and each group is a folder.

At first, you will only have a single, default group, named "Default". It will be assigned a "Default" patch policy that is turned off. The default group is configured to inventory each endpoint every 24 hours.

To create new groups, the “Create Group” button is located in the upper right section of the System Management screen. If you need to delete a Group, simply click to edit that group and click the red Delete Policy/Group button at the bottom of the screen.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="What is system management?" icon="icon-system-management">}}

The System Management page allows you to create, manage, and assign policies to groups (and vice versa) as well as the devices within those groups. This page shows your policies on the left side of the page and your groups on the right side of the page. We’ve also color coded the relationship between the policies and groups, and provided filters at the top of each section. Simply click on a policy to see what groups it’s assigned to, or click on a group to see what policies are assigned to it.

You can adjust the settings by clicking “Assign” or “Unassign”. Once you make changes, be sure to click Save (found near the bottom of the screen).
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="What is an organization?" icon="icon-organization">}}
Organizations are designed for users that need to separate billing across multiple accounts. Each organization has its own access key, systems and billing information. If you simply need to separate systems logically, groups are a better choice.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="How do I create a new organization?" icon="icon-New-Organizations">}}
An initial organization is created when you first create your account. To add an additional organizations, select Create New Organization from the menu on the top right of the console. You can switch your current view to a different organization through the same menu.
{{< /faqsection >}}
{{< /faqcolumn >}}

{{< faqcolumn >}}
{{< faqsection title="How do I restore a deleted endpoint?" icon="icon-deleted">}}
If you have deleted an endpoint from your console, but would like to add it back, the agent on the endpoint is probably still trying to connect using its old unique ID. To add it back to the console, you simply need to deregister the agent on the endpoint to get it to add itself back into the console.

See the <a href="https://www.automox.com/docs/user-guide/automox-agent/#deregistering-the-agent">Agent Deregistration Instructions</a> for details.
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title="How do I work with policies?" icon="icon-Policies">}}
As you begin to configure Automox for your needs, you’ll start by creating policies. Each policy handles a specific task, such as keeping your systems patched, ensuring software is installed, or anything else you can come up with. We break policies into three different policy types:

Patch - Keeps the OS software up to date

Required Software - Ensures that particular software is always installed

Custom - Used to perform any kind of custom configuration
{{< /faqsection >}}

{{< faqsection title=" Reports: What events are logged?" icon="icon-reports2">}}
The reports page of the console provides access to advanced reporting capabilities in the platform along with an activity log. There are the three advanced reports:

Overview Report: Provides a device overview, a history of patches applied, and outstanding patches with their aging. This report is designed to be shared with executives and provides a current snapshot of your overall system's vulnerability.

Pre-Patch Report: Shows you a list of all the pending patches per endpoint along with severity and exposure information allowing you to effectively assess internal impact.

Non-Compliance Report: Gives you a list of endpoints that need attention along with the relevant information, so you can focus on specific systems issues, saving valuable time and resources.

Activity log provides logging and reporting on the following Automox system events:

{{< unlinkedlist >}}
• Policy Actions - Any time a policy is executed, the actions performed along with success or failure will be reported

• Patch Actions - Any time a manual “Patch now” action is executed
